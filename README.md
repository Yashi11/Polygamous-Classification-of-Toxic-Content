# Polygamous-Classification-of-Toxic-Content
5 classes classification of toxic data obtained from jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge using Supervised Machine Learning Approaches to predict multiple-classifications for Course DS207.

The dataset has the following features:
- 159571 Datapoints
- 8 features for each datapoint
- Textual Comments classified into 5 Classes: 
    - Toxic 	
    - Severe_toxic 	
    - Obscene 	
    - Threat 	
    - Insult 	
    - Identity_hate
- Multi-Class Classification
